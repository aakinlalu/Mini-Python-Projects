""" 
Rockphysics Module
------------------
    
Write a module called "rockphysics" that has a single
function called "ggg" that calculates bulk density (rhob)
from P-wave velocity (vp) using the Gardner, Gardner, 
Gregory relationship::

    rhob = 1.741*vp**0.25
    
Import that module into this module and use the ggg 
function to:

1. Calculate rhob if vp=2.0
2. Calculate rhob for all the values::
    
        vp = [1.9, 2.0, 2.5, 2.1]

See :ref:`rockphysics-solution`.
"""

# Import the module [Use rockphysics in your example].
#import rockphysics_solution as rockphysics

# 1. Calculate rhob for vp=2.0
vp = 2.0 # km/s

# 2. Calculate rhob for a list of vp values.
#vp = [1.9, 2.0, 2.5, 2.1]
